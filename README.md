# Calories Burn Predictor

## Overview
This project utilizes machine learning to predict the number of calories burned based on various physical activities and personal attributes. The model is trained on structured fitness data.

## Features
- **Supervised Learning Algorithms**: Implements regression models to predict calorie expenditure.
- **Feature Engineering**: Data preprocessing includes normalization, feature scaling, and selection.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are used to assess model performance.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Personal attributes: Age, weight, height, gender.
- Activity-related metrics: Duration, heart rate, and intensity levels.

## Installation & Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn flask
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kilofrakh/calories-burn-predictor.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd calories-burn-predictor
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for training and evaluation.

## Web Application
Currently, work is in progress to deploy this project as a **Flask web application** for ease of use.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with real-time fitness trackers
- Deployment as a full-fledged web service
- Improved model accuracy using deep learning techniques
